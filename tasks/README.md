# Tasks Directory

This directory contains task files for tracking development work on the Music Dashboard project.

## Structure

Each task should be stored as a separate markdown file with a descriptive name:
- `feature-[name].md` - For new feature development
- `bug-[name].md` - For bug fixes
- `refactor-[name].md` - For refactoring work
- `docs-[name].md` - For documentation tasks

## Task Template

Use the `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` file as a starting point for new tasks. Each task should include:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive task name
- **Status**: Current state (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- **Priority**: Importance level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Description**: What needs to be done and why
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Notes**: Implementation details, blockers, or related information

## Usage

1. Copy `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` to create a new task file
2. Fill in the task details
3. Update the status as work progresses
4. Archive completed tasks to the `archive/` subdirectory when done
